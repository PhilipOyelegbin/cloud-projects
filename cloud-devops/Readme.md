# Cloud/DevOps Training Plan

This is a solid training plan that will provide a strong foundation in Cloud DevOps. To make the learning process effective, I structured it into progressive modules, each with hands-on projects. Here’s a **12-month structured training plan** with projects aligned to each skill area:

---

#### **Module 1: Introduction to DevOps and Cloud Fundamentals**

- Overview of DevOps principles, cloud computing, and industry best practices.
- Hands-on Lab: Set up free-tier accounts on AWS/Azure/GCP.
- Project: Deploy a simple static website using an S3 bucket or cloud storage service.

#### **Module 2: Linux, Scripting, and Version Control**

- Learn Linux fundamentals and shell scripting (Bash, Python).
- Introduction to Git, GitHub, and Git workflows.
- Project: Automate user and package installation on a Linux VM with Bash scripting.

#### **Module 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Basics**

- Introduction to Terraform/CloudFormation and infrastructure automation.
- Hands-on Lab: Deploy an EC2 instance or Virtual Machine using IaC.
- Project: Automate the deployment of a simple web server using Terraform.

---

### **Phase 2: Core DevOps Skills (Months 4-6)**

#### **Module 4: CI/CD Pipeline Design**

- Learn the fundamentals of CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
- Hands-on Lab: Set up a simple CI/CD pipeline for a sample application.
- Project: Implement a pipeline that builds and deploys a Dockerized web app to a cloud VM.

#### **Module 5: Containerization & Orchestration**

- Introduction to Docker and Kubernetes.
- Hands-on Lab: Create Docker images and deploy containers.
- Project: Deploy a multi-container application using Docker Compose.

#### **Module 6: Cloud Networking and Security Best Practices**

- Deep dive into networking concepts (VPCs, subnets, security groups, firewalls).
- Implement IAM roles and least privilege access controls.
- Project: Set up a secure VPC and deploy an application with restricted access.

---

### **Phase 3: Advanced Topics & Scaling (Months 7-9)**

#### **Module 7: Advanced Monitoring & Logging**

- Use Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog for monitoring.
- Hands-on Lab: Set up logging with CloudWatch, ELK stack, or OpenTelemetry.
- Project: Implement monitoring and alerting for an existing application.

#### **Module 8: Serverless & Advanced Cloud Services**

- Learn AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and GCP Cloud Functions.
- Hands-on Lab: Deploy a serverless function that processes event-based data.
- Project: Automate image resizing or log processing using a serverless architecture.

#### **Module 9: Incident Management & Disaster Recovery**

- Incident response and troubleshooting strategies.
- Hands-on Lab: Simulate system failures and conduct root cause analysis.
- Project: Design a high-availability infrastructure with automated recovery.

---

### **Phase 4: Leadership & Final Projects (Months 10-12)**

#### **Module 10: DevSecOps & Compliance**

- Implement security scanning in CI/CD pipelines (SAST, DAST).
- Hands-on Lab: Integrate vulnerability scanning with tools like Trivy.
- Project: Harden an existing infrastructure and enforce compliance policies.

#### **Module 11: Scaling Applications & Performance Optimization**

- Auto-scaling strategies, cost optimization, and load balancing.
- Hands-on Lab: Implement auto-scaling policies for an application.
- Project: Design and implement a scalable e-commerce or SaaS application.

#### **Module 12: Leadership & Final Capstone Project**

- Soft skills: Mentoring, documentation, and collaboration.
- Final Capstone Project: Build a complete DevOps pipeline, from infrastructure automation to CI/CD, security, and monitoring.
